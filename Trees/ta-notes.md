# Trees
Rooted : every node can be reached via a path from the root 
Acyclic : without cycles
Vertex: “nodes”
Edge: a connection between two vertices 
Path: sequence of edges
Parents: Node b, d, x have Node a as their parent
Children: b, d, x, are the children of a
Siblings: b, d, x, are siblings of each other

Ancestors: u has ancestors l, d, a
Descendants: x has s, m as its descendants

# Binary Trees
Each node has at most two children: left child and right child
Each node has a left and a right subtree (can be empty)
